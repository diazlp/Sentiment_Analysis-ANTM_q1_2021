# Sentiment Analysis - ANTM

## First Quarter of 2021

After some considerations, I decided to publish this old project into a personal repository. The language in PDF file is in Bahasa.

The purpose of the project was to predict whether a stock would went bullish or bearish based on Sentiment where the data was from Twitter API; I also scrapped some relevant data from reliable news. 

The stock code was ANTM which is PT Aneka Tambang, Tbk and in their first quarter of year 2021. The data that has been gathered was processed with a considered amount of modules in Python to get the results contained in the said PDF.
